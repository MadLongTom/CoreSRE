# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Memory & History Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec covers 4 user stories across 3 priority levels (P1, P2, P3) with a clear phased approach.
- 14 functional requirements are defined, all testable.
- 7 measurable success criteria are defined, all technology-agnostic.
- 5 edge cases are documented with expected behaviors.
- 7 assumptions are documented to capture reasonable defaults.
